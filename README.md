👋 Hi there! I'm **Archie**, a passionate independent developer from Taiwan 🇹🇼.

🚀 As the Partner at **[@RE:DREAMER](https://github.com/REDREAMERLab)**, I'm at the forefront of driving technology visions into reality. Alongside, I serve as the IG (Inspector General) at **[@Domin Network](https://github.com/domin-network)**, ensuring integrity and excellence across our projects.

📱 I have a penchant for crafting engaging iOS Apps on my own. My journey includes a successful proposal submission and approval at **[WAX Labs](https://labs.wax.io)**, a testament to my commitment to innovative and impactful solutions.

🔍 My roles span across strategic leadership, tech innovation, and rigorous quality assurance - a triad that defines my approach to the digital world.

👨‍💻 When I'm not in the tech trenches, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or sharing my knowledge and experiences with budding developers.
